## Welcome! üëã

Thank you for checking out my solution for the Frontend Mentor coding challenge. Frontend Mentor challenges provide a fantastic way to improve coding skills by building realistic projects. This project showcases my approach to integrating with the REST Countries API, implementing search and filter functionalities, and toggling between light and dark themes using GraphQL, styled-components, and Material UI.

# The Challenge

The goal of this challenge is to build an application that fetches data from the REST Countries API(https://restcountries.com) and displays it in a user-friendly manner. Here are the features that users should be able to interact with:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an input field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode

# Technologies Used

- Next.js: For server-side rendering and generating static websites.
- Styled-components: For component-level styling with support for dynamic themes.
- Material UI: For robust and customizable UI components and icons.

# Features and Implementation

- Home Page
  All Countries Display: Fetches and displays a list of all countries.

## What I Learned from this challenge üë©üèª‚Äçüíªüíú

This project provided me with the opportunity to enhance my skills in several key areas:

- Next.js: Although I am experienced with GraphQL, Material UI, and styled-components, this project was my first deep dive into Next.js. I learned how to effectively use server-side rendering, static site generation, and dynamic routing to optimize performance and SEO. I also explored Next.js' file-based routing system and how to integrate it seamlessly with GraphQL and Apollo Client.

- Styled-components: Improved my ability to create dynamic, themeable styles with styled-components, and learned how to integrate them with Next.js for both server-side and client-side rendering.

- Material UI: Continued to refine my usage of Material UI for building responsive, accessible, and visually appealing user interfaces, while learning how to optimize the integration with Next.js.

- API Integration: Enhanced my skills in integrating third-party APIs, handling asynchronous data fetching, and managing application state based on API responses, specifically within the Next.js framework.

# Future Enhancements

- Improved Accessibility: Ensuring all components are fully accessible.
- Performance Optimization: Further optimizing data fetching and component rendering.
- Additional Features: Adding user preferences storage for theme and region selection.

## Conclusion ‚ú®ü•≥üéâ

This project was a great opportunity to practice integrating APIs, managing state with Apollo Client, and implementing theme toggles with styled-components. If you have any suggestions or feedback, feel free to reach out!
